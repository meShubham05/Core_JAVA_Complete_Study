Here are some top string practice questions that are commonly asked in IT company placement drives:

1. Reverse a String

Problem: Given a string, reverse the string without using any built-in reverse methods.
Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"


2. Check if a String is a Palindrome

Problem: Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Example:
Input: "madam"
Output: true


3. Find the First Non-Repeating Character

Problem: Given a string, find the first character that does not repeat.
Example:
Input: "swiss"
Output: 'w'


4. Count the Number of Vowels and Consonants

Problem: Write a function to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: Vowels: 2, Consonants: 3


5. Remove Duplicates from a String

Problem: Given a string, remove all duplicate characters without using any additional data structures.
Example:
Input: "programming"
Output: "progamin"


6. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

Problem: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in any order).
Example:
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true


7. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Problem: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 (substring is "abc")


8. String Compression

Problem: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
Example:
Input: "aabcccccaaa"
Output: "a2b1c5a3"


9. Check if a String is a Rotation of Another String

Problem: Given two strings, check if one string is a rotation of another.
Example:
Input: "waterbottle", "erbottlewat"
Output: true


10. Longest Common Prefix

Problem: Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix among them.
Example:
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"


11. Count and Say

Problem: The "Count and Say" sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the rule: start with "1", and each subsequent term describes the previous term.
Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"


12. Check if a String Contains Only Digits

Problem: Write a function to check if a given string contains only digits.
Example:
Input: "12345"
Output: true


13. Convert Roman Numerals to Integer

Problem: Write a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
Example:
Input: "IX"
Output: 9


14. Longest Palindromic Substring

Problem: Given a string, find the longest substring that is a palindrome.
Example:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab" or "aba"


15. Group Anagrams

Problem: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
Example:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]
These questions cover various aspects of string manipulation, including searching, sorting, and pattern matching, and are frequently asked in technical interviews. Practice them thoroughly to increase your chances of success in placement drives.
