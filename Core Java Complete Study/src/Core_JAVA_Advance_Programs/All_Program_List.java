	Here are some advanced Core Java programs that cover a mixture of different concepts. These problems will challenge your understanding of Java and help you master various core concepts:

		1. File Compression and Decompression (I/O, Streams, Exception Handling)

		Write a program to compress a text file using GZIP and then decompress it back to its original form. Handle any I/O exceptions gracefully.
		Custom Thread Pool Implementation (Multithreading, Concurrency)

		2. Implement a custom thread pool from scratch. The pool should be able to manage a fixed number of threads and execute tasks in parallel.
		Banking System (OOP, Collections, Serialization, Exception Handling)

		3. Develop a mini-banking application where customers can open accounts, deposit/withdraw money, and view transactions. Use serialization to save the state of accounts to a file and handle exceptions like insufficient funds.
		Employee Management System (OOP, Interfaces, Collections, Generics)

		4. Create an Employee Management System where employees are categorized by roles (e.g., Manager, Developer) using interfaces. Store employees in a collection and provide functionalities like sorting by salary, searching by name, etc.
		Multithreaded Producer-Consumer Problem (Multithreading, Synchronization)

		5. Implement the classic producer-consumer problem using multiple threads, where producers generate data and consumers process it. Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
		Library Management System (OOP, Collections, Exception Handling)

		6. Build a library management system where users can borrow and return books. Implement features like tracking borrowed books, managing a waiting list, and handling exceptions for invalid operations.
		Custom Cache Implementation (Collections, Generics)

		7. Implement a generic LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a combination of LinkedHashMap and custom logic. The cache should store a limited number of elements and evict the least recently used one when the limit is reached.
		Real-time Chat Application (Multithreading, Networking)

		8. Create a simple console-based chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. Use multithreading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
		Student Grading System (OOP, Interfaces, Collections)

		9. Develop a system to manage student grades. Implement different grading strategies (e.g., average, weighted average) using interfaces and apply these strategies to calculate final grades.
		Custom Annotation Processor (Reflection, Annotations, Advanced OOP)

		10.	Create custom annotations and a processor that reads these annotations at runtime. Use reflection to validate the annotations and perform specific actions based on them.
		These programs will provide you with a broad practice in advanced Core Java concepts and help strengthen your problem-solving skills.
